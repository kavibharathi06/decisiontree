🎬 Movie Interest Prediction App | Machine Learning Project

This project is a simple Machine Learning application that predicts a user’s movie interest based on age and gender. A Decision Tree Classifier is trained on a small dataset and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

📌 Project Overview

The application takes user inputs such as age and gender and predicts the type of movie interest (e.g., Animation, Action, Drama). This project demonstrates the end-to-end ML workflow, from model training to deployment.
